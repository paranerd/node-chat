# NodeJS Chat

This is a Live Chat based on NodeJS and WebSockets with Socket.IO. I built it to demonstrate a usecase for WebSockets. You can sign up and join a chat of potentially thousands of clients.

You can check out how it's built in my "[Hello NodeJS](https://thegermancoder.com/2018/09/17/hello-nodejs-installation/)" introduction to NodeJS as well as my "[How To Build A Live Chat With WebSockets](https://thegermancoder.com/2018/10/17/how-to-build-a-live-chat-with-websockets/)".
